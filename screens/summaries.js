During the time of Yusuf (عليه السلام) the ruling dynasty were a foreign Arab peoples from Syria known as the Amalekites and had the ruling Hyksos kings (with no pharaoh as they had their own religion), hence Yusuf’s (عليه السلام) relative ease of integration. The Hyksos ruled over Egypt up to the end of the fifteenth century B. C. and practically all the powers remained in the hands of the Israelites. Then there arose a great nationalist movement which overthrew the power of this dynasty and exiled 250,000 or so of the Amalekites. As a result of this, a very bigoted dynasty of Copts came into power and uprooted everything connected with the Amalekites.

Pagan Arabs were mocking the situation claiming idolatry was defeating revealed religion, particularly after Chosroes captured Jerusalem massacring Christians and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Even seven to eight years after this prediction of the Qur’an, the conditions were such that no one could even imagine that the Byzantine Empire would ever gain an upper hand over Persia. Not to speak of gaining domination, no one could hope that the Empire, under the circumstances, would even survive. However Byzantine emperor Heraclius in 624 had attacked Persia and destroyed the birthplace of Zoroaster and ravaged the principal Fire temple of Persia. This was the very year when the Muslims achieved a decisive victory at Badr for the first time against the Disbelievers. Thus, both the predictions made in Surah Room were fulfilled simultaneously within the stipulated period of ten years. At the battle at Nineveh in 627 A.D. they dealt them the hardest blow to Persia which signalled the fulfilment of the prediction of the Qur’an. This was the year when the peace Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was concluded, which the Qur’an has termed as \"the supreme victory\". In 628 A. D., the Emperor himself went to Jerusalem to install the \"Holy Cross\" in its place, and in the same year the Prophet (ﷺ) entered Makkah for the first time after the Hijrah to perform the `Umra-tul-Qada'.

		    "period": "Medinan",
		    "context": "This was revealed in Dhil-Qadah, A. H. 6, at a time when the Prophet (ﷺ) was on his return journey to Medina after concluding the Truce of Hudaybiyyah with the Disbelievers of Makkah. Upon the Prophet (ﷺ) seeing a divine dream of umrah, he set out with his companions to Makkah despite its dangers. By going in a forbidden month, the Quraysh were hesitant to attack any tribe to provoke the defenceless Muslims and gain allies among the Arab tribes but failed as they were indeed only pilgrims. However, when Uthman (رضي الله عنه‎) was sent as a messenger to the Quraysh he was captured in the city, and then rumours of him being killed made the Muslims make the Pledge of Ridwan to fight to death. However, he came back and peace was negotiated at Hudaybiyyah, a great success (Al Fath) for Muslims in the long term but the Muslims felt humiliated in the short term. This treaty was made as the Muslims had set out to perform pilgrimage, and the Makkans decided to bar them at Hudaybiyyah from reaching the town and sent emissaries to have discussions with the Prophet (ﷺ). In the end the Prophet (ﷺ) signed a treaty that he and the Believers would not enter Makkah that year but would do so the next year. Seeing the long-term significance of this treaty, in the interests of peace he agreed to a truce of ten years during which time, if any Makkan went over to his side, he would return him to the Makkans, but if any of his people went over to the Makkans, they would not return them. The treaty made the Muslims: a recognised state from Arabs, able to perform pilgrimage, focus on other threat such as the Jews and Hypocrites and gave time to spread Islam across Arabia. It was all due to this treaty that two years later when in consequence of the Quraysh's violating the treaty the Prophet (ﷺ) invaded Makkah, he was accompanied by an army 10,000 strong, whereas on the occasion of Hudaybiyyah only 1,400 men had joined him in the march.   ",
		    "theme": "Throughout the surah the Prophet (ﷺ) is assured that this treaty that Allah has given him is a great breakthrough (cf. verses 1–3, 18–21, 27). The Believers are reassured that their self-restraint and obedience to the Prophet (ﷺ) were inspired by Allah. The surah condemns both the Hypocrites in Medina and the idolaters of Makkah and closes by praising the Believers. The surah talks about the moral and physical victory of Islam over the forces of unbelief.  The Hypocrites and Disbelievers will be disappointed with this victory.",

He built a magnificent cathedral in the capital Sanaa so that it would become a new pilgrimage site taking over Makkah increasing the city’s economic importance, and also a means to provoke the Arabs so that he could attack them. An Arab somehow got into the cathedral and defiled it upon which Abraha vowed to destroy the Ka’bah. He then set off to attack Makkah with a huge army which included elephants and defeated everyone in his path. When he arrived in Makkah, Abdul Muttalib (The Prophet’s (ﷺ) grandfather) represented the city and said that Allah will defend the Ka’bah as He is the owner. Abdul Muttalib then made supplication to Allah to protect His house and the people evacuated the city. When the army was arriving one of the elephants knelt towards Makkah refusing to move and swarms of birds carrying stones showered over the army decimating them leaving them to flee back.

Ikhlas conveys the meaning of sincerity in one’s religion and total dedication to the One true God. It speaks about the Oneness of Allah. Because of the importance of this theme in Islam, the Prophet (ﷺ) said that this surah, despite its brevity, was equal to one-third of the Qur’an. Narrated Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: The Prophet (ﷺ) said to his companions, \"Is it difficult for any of you to recite one third of the Qur'an in one night?\" This suggestion was difficult for them so they said, \"Who among us has the power to do so, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)?\" Allah Apostle replied: 'Allah (the) One, the Self-Sufficient Master Whom all creatures need.' (Surat Al-Ikhlas 112.1--to the End) is equal to one third of the Qur'an.\"",
